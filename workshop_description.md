[h1]Removable Health Vials[/h1]

Tired of leaving a half empty vial behind in your health station?
Want to squeeze out the last bit of juice at the next station?
Just like carrying around dead antlion grubs?

We've got you covered!

The addon allows you to take any health vial out of a health station no matter how much or little you've used, carry it in your wrist pocket, then put it in any other station!

Works in any map.

[i]This addon requires [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3329679071]AlyxLib[/url] to work.[/i]

Console commands allow you to customize and tweak the addon while playing. They are not required to use the addon, and for most users the default values will provide a good experience.

Console commands can be set in the [url=https://help.steampowered.com/faqs/view/7D01-D2DD-D75E-2955]launch options[/url] for Half-Life: Alyx, just put a hyphen before each name and the value after, e.g. [b]-close_health_station_on_vial_removal 1[/b]
They can also be added to your [b]Half-Life Alyx\game\hlvr\cfg\skill.cfg[/b] file, one per line without the hyphen, e.g. [b]close_health_station_on_vial_removal 1[/b]

[h2]Known Issues[/h2]

There is a slight visual glitch when a partially used vial is inserted into the station, where its plunger will slide up to the current value.

Health stations spawned after the map loads will not work correctly until they are opened up for the first time. Vials will not be removable from that station until it has been opened at least once.
